"""
AIS messages of type 5 are split into two
separate lines in our data set. 
This is because type 5 messages are built from 
two different fragments which need to be combined 
in a later stage of processing.

Therefore, this script appends every 2n-th row (n∈𝕫)to the
(2n-1)-th row. 
Put differently, the second row gets appended to the first, 
the 4th to the 3rd, 6th to the 5th and so on...

Headers are ignored and later redefined.

There are also some special properties to this data set
which also need to be addressed:
    - Raw messages in every (2n-1)-th line start
      with a single quote that is not terminated
    - On every 2n-th line, the messages are terminated 
      with a single quote but the starting quote is missing.
      
They are therefore added after reading the input file
